# HADashboard-Config
Configuration for Home Assistant (Hassio) AppDaemon HADashboard http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/INSTALL.html

My Home Assistant configuration: https://github.com/lmelvin/Home-Assistant-Config

This configuration consists of two dashboards: Home and Roomba

### Home Dashboard
Contains a general purpose dashboard that displays room and outside temp, controls for lights, door binary sensors, a refresh button, and a launcher for the Roomba dashboard.

### Roomba Dashboard
This is a dashboard that displays information and commonly used commands to control an iRobot Roomba 960
